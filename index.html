        <h1><b>Best practicies: <em>connecting & shaping data</em></b></h1>
        <p><b>Get yourself organized, before loading the data into Power BI</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Define clear and intuitive table names (no spaces!) from the start;
                updating them later can be a headache, especially if you've references them in
                multiple places.
            </li>
            <li>Establish a file/folder structure that makes sense from the start, to avoid having 
                to modify data source settings if file names or location change.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Disabling report refresh for any static scources</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>There's no need to constantly refresh sources that don't update frequently (or
                at all), like lookups or static data tables; only enable refresh for tables 
                that will be changing.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>When working with large tables, only load the data you need</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't include hourly data when you only need daily, or product-level transactions 
                when you only care about store-level performance; extra data will only slow you kown.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Database normalization</h1>
        <p><b>Normalization</b> is the process of organizing the tables and columns in a relational 
        database to reduce redundancy and preserve data integrity. It's commonly used to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Eliminate redundant data</b> to decrease table size and improve 
            processing speed & efficiency.</li>
            <li><b>Minimaze errors and anomalies</b> from data modifications 
            (inserting, updating or deleting records.</li>
            <li><b>Simplify queries</b> and structures the database for meainingful analysis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>TIP:</b> In a normalized database, each table should serve a <b>distinct</b> and <b>specific</b> 
        purpose (i.e. product information, dates, transaction records, customer attributes, etc.).</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1><b>Brst practicies: <em>data modeling</em></b></h1>
        <p><b>Focus on building a normalized model from the start</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure that each table in your model serves a single, distinct purpose.</li>
            <li>Use relationships vs. merged tables; long & narrow tables are better than short & wide.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Organize lookup tables above data tables in the diagram view</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>This serves as a visual reminder that filters flow "downstream".</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Avoid complex cross-filtering unless absolutely necessary</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't use two-way filters when 1-way filters will get the job done.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Hide fields from report view to prevent invalid filter context</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recommend hiding foreign keys from data tables, so that users can only access valid fields.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Meet <b>DAX</b></h1>
        <p><b>Data Analysis Expressions</b>, commonly known as <b>DAX</b>, is the formula 
        language that drives Power BI. With DAX, you can: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add calculated columns and measures to your model, using intuitive syntax.</li>
            <li>Go beyond the capabilities of traditional "grid-style" formulas, with powerful 
                and flexible functions built specifically to work with relational data models.
            </li>
            <li>Calculated columns are typically used for <b>filtering</b> data, rather than creating
            numerical values.</li>
            <li><b>Measures</b> are DAX formulas used to generate new calculated values.</li>
            <li>Use measures to create <b>numerical, calculated values</b> that can be analyzed in 
            the <b>"values"</b> field of a report visual.</li>
        </ul>
